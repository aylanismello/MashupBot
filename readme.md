# MashupBot

### Background

As a Mashupologist myself, I thought it'd be fun to give people the chance to make their own mashups on the fly. All built with Web technologies! 

### Architecture and Technologies
This project used the following technologies:

* Vanilla js
* The Canvas API
* The Web Audio API for sound control
* WebAudioScheduler NPM package for scheduling sound events
* Hammer.js for touch events
* React for organizing the view layer hierarchy of elements
* Webpack to bundle and serve all the scripts

### Implementation Timeline

#### Day 1
* Make each song button a play button
* Create grid view (รก la Ableton) for selecting different tracks of a certain type
(this requires a switching/toggle/solo mechanisms)


#### Day 2
* Add nicer graphics to buttons, with artist photo
* Redesign storage of tracks/representation such that image urls are
easy to pull up

#### Day 3
* Start transition from normal click events to hammer.js powered
touch events

#### Day 4
* Final chance for adding snazzier graphics, final stretch features.
